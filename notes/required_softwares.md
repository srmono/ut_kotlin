To run Kotlin, you need to set up the Kotlin environment on your system. Here are the essential software components:

1. **JVM (Java Virtual Machine):** Kotlin is designed to run on the Java Virtual Machine, so you need to have a JVM installed on your machine. You can use OpenJDK or Oracle JDK.

   - **OpenJDK:** You can download and install OpenJDK from the official website: [OpenJDK Downloads](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
   - **Oracle JDK:** If you prefer Oracle JDK, you can download it from the official Oracle website: [Oracle JDK Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)

2. **Kotlin Compiler:**

   - **Kotlin Compiler (kotlinc):** You can download the Kotlin compiler from the official Kotlin website: [Kotlin Downloads](https://kotlinlang.org/download/)

3. **IDE (Integrated Development Environment):** While not strictly required, using an IDE can significantly enhance your Kotlin development experience. Popular choices include:

   - **IntelliJ IDEA:** JetBrains, the company behind Kotlin, develops IntelliJ IDEA, which has excellent support for Kotlin. You can download it from the official website: [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

   - **Eclipse:** Eclipse is another IDE that supports Kotlin through plugins. You can install the Kotlin plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace.

4. **Build Tool (Optional):**

   - **Gradle:** Gradle is a popular build tool, and it works seamlessly with Kotlin projects. You can include Kotlin support in your Gradle project by adding appropriate dependencies.

   - **Maven:** If you prefer Maven, you can also use it to build Kotlin projects. Maven has Kotlin support through plugins.

After installing the required software components, you should be able to write, compile, and run Kotlin code on your system. If you're using an IDE, it often simplifies the process of setting up Kotlin projects and managing dependencies.
